# Nonparametric Classification Algorithm With Gaussian Kernel

Implement the multivariate nonparametric classification algorithm with Gaussian kernel from scratch. Use Mahalanobis distance d( x , y ) = ( x − y )S ( x − y ) to normalize the variances. S denotes the covariance matrix of the training set. Run your classifier on Optdigits data set. Use optdigits.tra as your training set and optdigits.tes as the test set. Plot the confusion matrix and report the accuracy of your classifier.
